# TFTG
Identification of indication specific transcription factors

AIM: To understand how a given transcription factor performs across multiple indications

STEPS:
1) Find a reliable database that has data on Transcription factor and its respective targets with proper experimental backup
Database chosen for this study: TRRUST


-> Experimentally validated


-> small dataset


-> Contains data on actual regulation and not predictions


-> PMID supported

2) Download the mRNA expression dataset for indication of choice from Cbioportal

Indications tested in this case scenario: 

Invasive breast cancer

Adenocortical carcinoma

Cholangiocarcinoma (PancancerAtlas)

4) Filter the TF-TG from the dataset
